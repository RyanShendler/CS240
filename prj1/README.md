### Tracing Record Database Part 1

This directory contains code that implements a database that stores hypothetical COVID-19 tracing records. 
Each tracing record is represented as an instance of the Tracing_Record class and stores the patient's first and last name, the date, time and location
of their diagnosis and their body temperature.
This is simple implementation that uses static arrays. Therefore, the database can only store up to 100 tracing records.
