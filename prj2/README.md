### Tracing Record Database Part 2

This is an improved implementation of Tracing Record Database from Part 1. 
This implementation has been improved to allow multiple databases to be stored and modified.
Additionally, I implemented dynamic arrays, which allow the databases to grow dynamically as more tracing records are added.
I also added the ability to read or write databases to files, which allows the databases to persist over several runs of the program.
