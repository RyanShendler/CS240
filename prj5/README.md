### Customer Database Project

Collaborated with a fellow student to create a customer database for hypothetical ecommerce company "Jamazon."
Database allows Jamazon customers to create an account, update their account name, purchase items, and view their transaction history.
The database also supported the ability for Jamazon employees to identify customers who have spent the most money on Jamazon and reward those customers with "Jambucks."
In order to make the database more efficient, our group decided to implement two data structures: a BST and a heap.
The BST was organized alphabetically and was used to search for users based on their user ID. 
This was used by any operations performed by the user, such as purcahsing items, changing their user ID or viewing their transaction history.
Meanwhile, the heap was used to sort users based on the amount of money they had spent, and was used to award the top-spending customers with Jambucks.
